# Reddit MoneyConverterBot
This is the first bot I've ever made, and the first useful (...debatebly) thing I've ever written. I'm very new to Python, so it's quite likely that my code's a mess, but at least it works! (I'll try to clean it up a bit when I learn more about the language.)

Basically, at the stage it's in now:
MoneyConverterBot grabs any string in a comment that starts with '$', passes it through the converter and then replies to the comment with a table of converted results.
So... nothing too special, but hopefully I'll be able to refine the code and add more features as I learn more about Python.
